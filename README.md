# Kaggle Hackathon: telecom-churn-hackathon

## Introduction
In this project, I aim to explore and implement machine learning techniques to predict the attrition rate of the customers of a telecom company. The goal of the project is to predict which customer is at high risk of churn.

## About the Project
Attrition rate or Churn for telecom company is an important factor that defines its success, as it costs more to acquire a customer than retaining one. So, the project focusses on predicting high risk of churning customers, which can further be used to make decision on retension offers for the customer.

## Problem Understanding
- There are 171 explanatory variables and 1 (churn_probability) response variable given in the data.
- The target variable churn_probability contains 1 or 0 (churn or no churn).
- We use train data to train our model, and test (unseen data) for submission.

## Techniques:
- I have applied feature engineering and feature selection.
- I have used models like Random forest classifier, XGBoost Classifier, LGBoost Classifier, GBM Classifier.
- I have also played around undersampling, oversampling, oversampling with balanced random forest classifier to handle the unbalanced class.

## Impact:
- I have explored different techniques of feature engineering and feature selection.
- I have explored different ways to handle the imbalanced data.
